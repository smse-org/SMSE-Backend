2. Run `poetry install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment
4. Run `flask db upgrade` to create the database
5. Run `smse-backend` to start the server

## Development

If you made changes to the models, you need to run `flask db migrate` to generate a new migration file. After that, you need to run `flask db upgrade` to apply the changes to the database.
